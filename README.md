# **Passing Information with Children in React**

When first learning React, one of the early concepts you'll encounter is the use of **props** to pass data from a parent component to its child components. Props are a fundamental part of how React enables reusable and modular code, setting it apart from vanilla JavaScript.

However, there's another powerful way to pass content to child components: the **children** prop. This approach allows you to embed data or JSX directly within the child component's tags. 

While props remain a versatile tool for explicit data transfer, **children** can sometimes make your code more intuitive and easier to read.

In this lab, we'll explore how to use **children** effectively and when it might be a better choice than props.
